    <h1>Find the unique number</h1>
    <pre> 
        There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!

        findUniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) === 2
        findUniq([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) === 0.55
        Itâ€™s guaranteed that array contains more than 3 numbers.
        
        The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.
        
        This is the first kata in series:
        
        Find the unique number (this kata)
        Find the unique string
        Find The Unique
